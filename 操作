Starting the Joy Node
In this section we use ros-indigo-joy package. Assume the joystick driver has been isntalled, to get the joystick data published over ROS we need to start the joy node. First let's tell the joy node which joystick device to use- the default is js0.

$ roscore
$ rosparam set joy_node/dev "/dev/input/jsX" 
Configuring the Joystick and make sure that the joystick is working.

$ ls /dev/input/
$ sudo jstest /dev/input/jsX 
Now we can start the joy node

$ rosrun joy joy_node
In a new terminal you can rostopic echo the joy topic to see the data from the joystick

$ rostopic echo joy 
Then run the teleop_twist_joy node from teleop_twist_joy package with command configurations. We recommend the following launch file which launches both joy node and teleop node with right configurations.

$ roslaunch teleop_twist_joy teleop.launch
